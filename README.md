# Project-BattleshipGame

A multiplayer Battleship game, designed as an engaging turn-based gameplay experience for shared devices, showcases my role as the lead programmer working alongside four others.

As the level of difficulty increases, the grid size expands, making the ships progressively harder to locate.
