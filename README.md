# Project - Battleship Game

A multiplayer Battleship game, designed as an engaging turn-based gameplay experience for shared devices, showcases my role as the lead programmer working alongside four others. This project is a modern twist on the classic Battleship game, featuring three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. As the level of difficulty increases, the grid size expands, making the ships progressively harder to locate.
